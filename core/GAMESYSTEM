- Multiple animals "clans"
- the animals are at first neutral. They didn't attack the player, they didn't approach it.
- If the player attacks an animal:
	The animal is stronger than the player, he will be aggressive with him.
	The animal is weak than the player, he will run.
	The animal have a group of other animals and decide to attack with his group.

Mutants IA:
- Mutants have to be like old humans. They have to react like humans.
- if the mutants is near his territory, he will defend it.
- Mutants stands together. If there is a mutant, he will call other mutants.
- Mutants didn't attack directly, they wait for the best moment to attack.
- If they are more then 3, they will encircle the player.
